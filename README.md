# hcp-reddit-usernames
This repo provides the most exhaustive list of available usernames on reddit that are also in the English corpus. It acheives this by using parallel processing to ping at a much faster rate than possible using a single processor.

# Usage
If you're using a hpc, you can run the batch script `multiprocessing/run.pbs` with your own preferences. Otherwise, simply install the dependencies and simply run `python main.py`.

# Statistics
*(As of August 2020)*  
Out of the ~130,000 english words checked, approximately 44,744 are available Reddit usernames. Below are the top eight available usernames (at the time of scraping), sorted by frequency in the English language.
